	- Fixed a typo(section 3.3.2). Thanks to plus <plus.bbs@bbs.sayya.org>

	* story.tex:
	- Fixed a typo(section 1.2). Thanks to qrtt1 <qrtt1.bbs@bbs.sayya.org>.

2003-12-16  Edward G.J. Lee  <edt1023@info.sayya.org>

	* preparation.tex:
	- Let the introduction of commercial TeX be a \section.

	* syntax.tex:
	- Some special typesetting results of LaTeX, we use picture in
	  HTML version now.

	* pic.sh:
	- Don't use pic.sh to convert a eps to png. We grab
	  the png image via gv/xv now.

	* latex123.tex:
	- Turn off pslatex package and background before we
	  release a stable version. We need grab some picture
	  from white background.

	* abbreviation.png, abbreviation2.png, dots.png, quotation.png:
	- Sigh, some typesetting effects cannot be expressed
	  in HTML format. We grab a PNG image for HTML version.
	  I don't like this method. :(

	* latex-flow.png:
	- It looks ugly if we produce eps from latex-flow.tex and
	  convert -scale to PNG image. So we grab the PNG picture
	  via gv/xv and include it when make HTML version.

2003-12-15  Edward G.J. Lee  <edt1023@info.sayya.org>

	* class.tex:
	- Added \label{ch:class}.

	* abook.tex:
	- Rebuild the structure of this chapter, but may be modified
	  again.

	* start.tex:
	- Added attention of diffrence between PDF and HTML format.

	* pic.sh:
	- Still need bg5latex because my ugly makefile dependency.

	* syntax.tex: 
	- The typesetting rules of punctuation.

	* syntax.tex:
	- A typo of 3.3. Thanks to dos <dos.bbs@bbs.cs.nthu.edu.tw>.
	- Rules of LaTeX typesetting.

	* preparation.tex:
	- Sigh, still a typo on Scientific Word. Thanks to Eric
	  <ericyu.bbs@twolights.twbbs.org>

	* latex123.tex:
	- It's a good idea to introduce LaTeX class after we really
	  writing some practical examples.

	* syntax.tex:
	- Typo and bug fixed about special characters.

	* latex-flow.tex:
	- Remove psframebox of the picture, it looks ugly. No box
	  unless necessary.

	* pic.sh:
	- Because *.cjk are dependent on *.tex, so we use latex instead
	  bg5latex on *.cjk now.

	* Makefile:
	- Added latex-flow.eps dependence. Ugly dependence, sigh.

	* hyperref.cfg:
	- Some version of hyperref cannot find hyperref.cfg, so we need
	  a hyperref.cfg in working directory.

2003-12-14  Edward G.J. Lee  <edt1023@info.sayya.org>

	* preparation.tex:
	- Ooops, still typo on Scientific spelling. Fixed. :(

	* pic.sh:
	- Don't use epstopdf to convert epsi to pdf, mv epsi to eps
	  then include in tex file, latex/dvipdfm can handle it without
	  *.bb file. But still need to convert to *.png to be included
	  by latex2html.

	* preparation.tex:
	- Modified a Chinese word of bundle. Thanks to,
	  Chun-Chieh Huang <jjhuang@cm.nctu.edu.tw>,
	  Eric <ericyu.bbs@twolights.twbbs.org>,
	  descent <descent.bbs@bbs.sayya.org>.

	* latex-flow.tex:
	- New file, only can compile via latex/dvips to produce eps,
	  so we make it a standalone picture then include it.

	* Makefile:
	- Adde pic.sh to produce pdf/png from another LaTeX picture document.

	* pic.sh:
	- We need pic.sh to produce pdf/png from another LaTeX document.
	  Because we use dvipdfm[x], cannot accept eps files directly.

	* syntax.tex:
	- Finished, but not satisfactory. Will modisfy later.

	* latex123.tex:
	- Change the version to 0.1 draft.

	* preparation.tex:
	- Added cygwin environment on Windows. Thanks to Seventeen
	  <Seventeen.bbs@bbs.sayya.org>

	* story.tex:
	- ATOCP volumn 6-7 may change the name of the book. Thanks to
	  Chun-Chieh Huang <jjhuang@cm.nctu.edu.tw>

	  book.tex, don't know why. :(
	- We need adjust the HTML css BODY's line-height to 160%, because
	  of the MS IE interpreter line-height behave different with other
	  WWW browser when we use \sup HTML markup.

	* abook.tex, book.tex:
	- Instead book.tex of abook.tex, because LaTeX2HTML will miss
