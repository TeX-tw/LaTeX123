\section{The {\it Dog}\/ in the Manger}

A \textbf{\textit{dog}} lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping
prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been
placed for them.

``What a selfish Dog!'' said one of them to his companions;
``he cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow
those to eat who can.''

\chapter{The \textsc{Eagle} and the Arrow}

An \textsc{eagle} sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a
Hare whom he sought to make his prey.

An archer, who saw the \textsc{Eagle} from a place of concealment,
took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally.
